# SkillCraftTechnology Data Science Internship Project

# Project Overview
This repository contains my data science internship project at Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd. The project focuses on data analysis, and visualization to gain insights from a dataset provided during the internship.

# Task1_SkillCraft_internship
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population

# Task2_SkillCraft_internship
Perform Data Cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a dataset of your choice ,such as the Titanic dataset from kaggle, Explore the realtionship between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data

# Task3_SkillCraft_internship
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. use a dataset such as the bank marketing dataset from the UCI machine Learning Respository 
# Task4_SkillCraft_internship
Anallyze traffic accident data to identify patterns reated to road conditions,weather,and time of day.visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Purpose and Objectives
